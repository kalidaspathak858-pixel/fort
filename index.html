'Forts are the very basis of a kingdom. Forts themselves are the kingdom, forts are the origin of the kingdom, forts are the real treasure of the kingdom, forts are the basis of an army, forts are the wealth of the kingdom, forts are our best form of defence.'

Aadnyaapatra, by Ramchandra Pant Amatya, chief minister of Rani Tarabai.

The English word 'fort' is derived from the Latin word 'fortis' meaning strong.

Forts were a primary defence mechanism in Maharashtra against enemy invasions, and had been so since ancient times. They are known in the local language as 'killa' (or 'qila' in Urdu). They were naturally and artificially protected human settlements, guarded by elements such as hills, forests, the desert, the sea, and man-made stone structures which formed a kind of armour around them.

One of the early reference to forts in the subcontinent occurs in the ancient political treatise, 'Arthashastra' by Kautilya, whereby Kautilya classifies the forts as Jal durg (water forts), Giri durg (mountain forts), Vana durg (forest forts), Dhanu durg (arid/desert forts located in conditions which are devoid of a ready water supply), Mahi durg (brick forts), and Nar durg (human forts), not to mention the ancient cities in kingdoms such as Mathura, Magadha, and so on which were also mentioned as being fortified settlements. The social treatise, 'Manusmriti' by Manu, also describes the advantages and disadvantages of different classifications of fort.

<p>
Due to its peculiar topography, Maharashtra has always revelled in different forms of fort constructions. Its structures and architectural designs have differed depending upon their region and location, whether these are on the plains, coastal areas, hilly terrain or in the dense forests.

The forts in Maharashtra were constructed from the point at which some of the early ruling dynasties (and their vassals) held power, such as the Satvahanas, the Rashtrakutas, the Kadambas, the Chalukyas, the Yadavas, the Afghans, the Bahmanis, the Gonds in Berar, the sultanates of Ahmednagar, Bijapur and Berar, the Siddis, the Europeans (British, Portuguese), and last but not the least the Marathas.

The Marathas gave tremendous importance to forts as they were their strongest defence against marauding invaders. Due to the inherent hilly terrain of the Sahyadri range, most of their forts belonged to the 'hill' category. These forts protected the army and the wealth of the kings and housed virtually an entire village inside the fort. </p>
