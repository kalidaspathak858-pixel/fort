<center><h1> TREKKING </h1></center>



Trekking is making a journey on foot, especially to hike through mountainous areas often for multiple days and along lovely mountains villages and enjoying nature and/or close contact with people in remote mountain villages where lifestyle sometimes is unchanged since many generations.

You will trek through ancient fort ruins and caves, overlook old trade routes, and discover secret passageways and cannons. Most of the top fort treks in Maharashtra take you past waterfalls and streams, over rocky patches, and stop by natural pools filled with fresh water.

Regular trekking and hiking are said to reduce the blood pressure and balance the body’s cholesterol & triglycerides levels as well. This helps improve the circulatory & respiratory system.
